OpenNoteScanner is an open-source application that provides a way to scan handwritten notes and printed documents using your mobile device.

### Features

* Automatic edge detection of documents on contrasting surfaces.
* Perspective correction to a 90-degree top-down view.
* Support for a [printed special page template](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner/raw/master/Page%20Templates/A4%20with%202%20pages.pdf) with a QR code for instant scanning.
* Ability to launch from other applications requesting images.
* Organize scanned documents in a local gallery.
* Export scans as a PDF or share as an image.

Requirements
------------

- Due to the version of OpenCV that is used, this project requires Android 5.0 (lollipop) or newer to run.

- In order to capture and manipulate images, Open Note Scanner depends on having the OpenCV Manager application installed.
    - If not installed, Open Note Scanner will ask to download it from https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenCV-3.1.0-Android or from the Google Play Store.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

Building from Source
-------------------------

### Android Studio

1. Import the project from GitHub using File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> GitHub, enter the URL https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner.git
2. Choose the base directory (usually AndroidStudioProjects, but you can change it to your preference).
3. Build the project.

### Command Line

Go to your base folder and import it using ```git```:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner.git
```

This should import the Open Note Scanner repository in OpenNoteScanner folder

You need to point the environment variable ```ANDROID_HOME``` to your Android SDK folder and run ```gradle``` to build the project:

```
$ cd OpenNoteScanner
$ export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk-linux
$ ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Contributing
-------------------------
Contributions are always welcome! If you're new to open-source, please check our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Setup Guidelines](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner/blob/master/SETUP_GUIDELINES.md). Feel free to fork the project and submit pull requests.

History
-------

I started this app while on a brazilian holiday (that is, an "extended weekend") based on the fact that I was unable to find any open source application that does this job. I was mainly inspired by the RocketBook Wave closed source application.

I really do not know if I will extend the application more, but I have written some objectives below on how to make it better.

Roadmap
-------

* Enhance the image gallery of scanned documents.
* Register a share action in order to obtain documents already pictured through standard camera apps.
* Implement an automatic action based on the RocketBook Wave marking of the page.

Donations
---------

My job is on enterprise servers administration and some development consulting. I do collect money from my customers. I am well paid for that.

For being part of open source projects and documenting my work here I really do not charge anything. I am trying to avoid any type of ads also.

If you think that any information you obtained here is worth of some money and are willing to pay for it, feel free to send any amount through PayPal or Bitcoin.

In order to fund the development of Open Note Scanner, since version 1.0.36 when downloaded from Google Play Store the app will show ads on some screens and will also allow for donation through Google Play in-app purchase. There is no difference on the features available from Google Play version and F-Droid releases.
